# Image Classification with CNNs & Self-Supervised Learning  

This repository contains machine learning projects focused on image classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **self-supervised learning techniques**.

## Project Overview

Two main approaches are explored for image classification:  
1. **Supervised CNNs** – Building and training convolutional neural networks on labeled image datasets.  
2. **Self-Supervised Learning** – Learning meaningful image representations without labels, then applying them to classification tasks.  

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of baseline CNN models for supervised learning  
- Self-supervised representation learning workflow  
- Model training, evaluation, and performance comparison   

**Dataset Includes:**
- Image datasets for supervised classification (CIFAR-10)
- Augmented views for self-supervised pretraining
